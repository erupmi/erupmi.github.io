<h1 id="why-is-callcc-nonconstructive">Why is <code
class="verbatim">call/cc</code> nonconstructive</h1>
<p>We know that <code class="verbatim">call/cc</code> corresponds to
Peirce Law <code class="verbatim">((α → β) → α) → α</code>, which
implies double negations of classical logic. Then we may ask: don't we
implement <code class="verbatim">call/cc</code> in the computer(e.g.
through CEK machine)? Isn't it a contradiction that <code
class="verbatim">call/cc</code> is not constructive by Curry-Howard
Isomorphism?</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>From the implementation perspective, <code
class="verbatim">call/cc</code> (as a primitive) is implemented through
an abstract machine to manipulate control flow. It cannot be implemented
with substitution only operation. So, it's different from all other
constructive logical operations.</p>
<h2 id="violation-of-church-rosser-theorem">Violation of Church-Rosser
Theorem</h2>
<p>Here's an example from <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9050725/call-cc-implementation">stakcoverflow</a>
where <code class="verbatim">call/cc</code> breaks the Church-Rosser
theorem:</p>
<pre><code>(define (f c)
  ;; by confluence the next two can execute in arbitrary order
  (+ (c 2) (c 3)))

(call/cc f)
</code></pre>
<p>In an imperative language like <strong>C</strong> you cannot swap the
<em>evaluation order</em> of <code class="verbatim">return</code>
arbitrarily to get the same result, even though it's fine in do notation
of Haskell's monad (many people actually suggest to use <code
class="verbatim">pure</code> instead of <code
class="verbatim">return</code> in Haskell to avoid confusions). <code
class="verbatim">call/cc</code> breaks the control flow like <code
class="verbatim">return</code>, so we cannot swap the order of
evaluation as stated in Church-Rosser theorem. If we switch the order of
plus, we get different results (2 for the left evaluation first, 3 for
the right first). Therefore we could not use it as a deductive system,
since sequent calculus and natural deduction should follow
Church<sub>rosser</sub> theorem, which is a prerequsite for
normalizations.</p>
<h2 id="how-about-continuation-passing-style">How About Continuation
Passing Style</h2>
<p>We know that <code class="verbatim">call/cc</code> can be translated
to continuation passing style. A tautology from classical logic with
double negation transform is also a tautology provable in intuitionistic
logic. The above example will be translated to following by CPS:</p>
<pre><code>(define (f c* k)
  (c* 2 (lambda (x)
        c* 3 (lambda (y)
                (k (+ x y))))))
</code></pre>
<p>Without the magical blackbox, we define <code
class="verbatim">call/cc</code> as <code
class="verbatim">(lambda (f cc) (f (lambda (x k) (cc x)) cc))</code>.
It's still confluent(equivalent to Church-Rosser theorem) because the
CPS process will <em>assume</em> a correct calling order for us. When we
call <code class="verbatim">(call/cc f (lambda (x) (x)))</code>, it
applys user defined <code class="verbatim">cc</code> and abandons the
previous frames <code class="verbatim">k</code>. You can imagine
continuation passing style as explicitly inserting user-defined
functions on control frames, as a result, users may modify all the
control behaviours. Therefore, we could preserve the Church-Rosser
Theorem while manipulating the frame under CPS. Again, it's still
different from the primitive operation version of <code
class="verbatim">call/cc</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>From a computation perspective, reduction is more likely to be
implemented in weak reduction. However, it's necessary to think on the
strong reduction for proof system. The minor difference under
Curry-Howard isomorphism causes missing interpreation from different
perspective. A more precise statement would be: "We could not implement
a primitive <code class="verbatim">call/cc</code> operation which
guarantees Church-Rosser Properties".</p>
